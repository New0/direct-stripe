######Actions and Filter hooks available for developers <https://newo.me/direct-stripe-actions-and-filters-hooks/>***

== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin files to the /wp-content/plugins/direct-stripe directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress
3. Log in to your stripe's account or create one at https://dashboard.stripe.com/register
4. Configure settings and buttons in admin panel

Minimal steps :

- Copy API keys from the Stripe dashboard under Developers -> API keys

- Paste Stripe API keys in your WordPress admin at Direct Stripe -> settings under the Global settings tab ( I recommend copying live and test keys at once, then simply use the test option to use test keys).

- Create a button under the Buttons Settings tab ( the button requires at least a type and an amount in order to work => ( amount if the type is payment, Princing Plan ID if the type is a subscription and nothing if the type is Donation ) )

- Go to the page/post you want to insert a button into and select the Direct Stripe Gutenberg Block, then select the button to display within the block. ( in the case you use the old editor, use the Direct Stripe button on top of the editor to insert the button)

You can also insert direct stripe buttons using a shortcode `[direct-stripe value="ds-154185704588"]` (useful for widgets and templates) (  ds-1541857045880 being the unique ID of the button created at Direct Stripe settings under the Buttons Settings tab )
